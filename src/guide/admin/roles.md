# Roles
Roles may be freely created and edited by the admin. By allocating permissions to those new roles, the
admin can thereby control which functions each user may access.

1. Within the admin area (top left), you need to select **Roles** within the left navigation.

2. **View** existing roles (Optional: Use the search bar at the top).
3. **See/Edit details and Permissions** for each role by clicking the blue triple-bar button on the right of the role.
   Doing so shows the general description of the role.

   permissions allocated to this role or allocate/withdraw permissions to/from this role.
