# Proposal Review
A Proposal is an organizational unit in the PHT, which represents the collaboration between different participants in regard to a specific research or analysis project.  
It contains an initial risk assessment as well as a high level description of the requested data.

In the **Home** section press **Proposals** in the menu on the left-hand side.
At first, you will lead to the **outgoing**-proposals section, where you can see a list of all the proposals created by this station. Via the searchbar you can filter after the name.
You have the option to adjust the already existing proposals via the **List**-icon or to delete the proposal via the **bin**-icon. Furthermore, you can see, who exactly created that proposal.

Moreover, you have the option to switch to the **incoming** section or to create a new proposal on the left side between the menu and the overview-list.
