Before a valid train is built, it requires approval. Here, you may review the analysis code and see whether your provided station data will be used according to the study protocol. If it is, approve the train. If it is not, you may reject the train, effectively blocking its execution on your site. If you do so, we encourage you to inform the data analyst of the reason so they can revise it. After approval or rejection of each site, the train is built.</p><p>To review trains, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Within the home area (top left), you need to select <strong>Trains</strong> in the left navigation, and then the Option <strong>Incoming</strong> to its right.</li><li>Here, you can view all approved, rejected, as well as trains awaiting either (Optional: Use the search bar at the top). <a href="/images/ui_images/train_incoming.png"><img src="'+n+'" alt="image"></a></li><li><strong>Review</strong> incoming train analysis scripts by clicking the black download button on the right of the train.</li><li><strong>Approve</strong> incoming trains by clicking the gray triple-bar button on the right of the train and then clicking the green approve button in the small popup.</li><li><strong>Reject</strong> incoming trains by clicking the gray triple-bar button on the right of the train and then clicking the red reject button in the small popup.</li><li><strong>Refresh</strong> this list anytime by clicking the black refresh button on the top right.</li></ol>',4),s=[r];function l(c,h,p,g,d,u){return e(),i("div",null,s)}const f=t(o,[["render",l]]);export{m as __pageData,f as default};
