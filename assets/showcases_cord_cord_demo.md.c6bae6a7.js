But there is a major difference: any train will be approved and executed. There is no one to validate, if something malicious is ongoing. In case you saved all patient data as fake results in the train, you did not break the system nor hacked the architecture. We allowed you and automatically executed your train to do so.</p>',41),f=[b];function g(y,_,w,q,T,k){return t(),o("div",null,f)}const R=e(m,[["render",g]]);export{x as __pageData,R as default};
