It is submitted by a user, who includes information on its data usage, its analysis pipeline and other related contents. Trains are created and submitted for review within the Central App, then build, encrypted and send on their way to the stations as docker containers. Upon arrival and decryption of the script at a local station it may be reviewed one last time, before allowed access to the data for analysis. Afterwards the train will be sent to the next station, ultimately returning it to the user, who may decrypt the results of their analysis.</p><p>In the <strong>Home</strong> section press <strong>Trains</strong> in the menu on the left-hand side. At first, you will lead to the <strong>outgoing</strong>-trains section, where you can see a list of all the trains created by this realm. Via the searchbar you can filter after the name. You have the option to view configuration details of already existing trains via the <strong>List</strong>-icon or to delete the train via the <strong>bin</strong>-icon. You can also view a drop-down menu of the train&#39;s current state by clicking the <strong>Arrow-down</strong>-icon.</p><p>Moreover, you have the option to switch to the <strong>incoming</strong> section or to create a new train on the left side between the menu and the overview-list.</p><h2 id="creation" tabindex="-1">Creation <a class="header-anchor" href="#creation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Creation&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In the <strong>Home</strong> section you can choose <strong>Trains</strong> in the menu on the left-hand side.
