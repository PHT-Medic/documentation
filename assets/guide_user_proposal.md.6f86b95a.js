But data can be quite different depending on combinations of all data. Private medical data in general contains really sensitive information and needs to be handled accordingly. For this, you give a risk estimation, so that each station has an idea about the level of data sensitivity accessed by the train. This estimation is categorized into three stages:</p><ul><li>Low risk (<em>green</em>): The train won&#39;t use any personal related data, such as calculation about all Loinc-Codes of Observation-Resources in a FHIR-Server.</li><li>Mid risk (<em>yellow</em>): The train will use only one or hardly any personal information of a patient such as gender or age. One param will not be harmful at all, but should still be mentioned when used during the process.</li><li>High (<em>red</em>): The train in general will perform some calculation/analysis on private data where it may be possible that private information will be figured out about a single person. This can occur when the calculations will be performed on a lot of personal information of only a few participants. Overall this should nevertheless not be an issue when the FHIR-Servers provide enough privacy-preserving measurements such as pseudonymization or anonymization.</li></ul><h2 id="approval" tabindex="-1">Approval <a class="header-anchor" href="#approval" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Approval&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Before an analysis can be performed based on your submitted proposal, it must be approved by the stations you selected.
